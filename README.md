# vue-ssr-demo

Demo for Vue 2.0 server-side rendering.

``` bash
npm install
npm start
```

Although this demo uses JSX, it also works with `vue-loader`. It doesn't actually matter how you build your application bundle.

For how things work, check out the [docs](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/next/packages/vue-server-renderer).
