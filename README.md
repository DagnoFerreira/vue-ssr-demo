# vue-ssr-demo

Demo for Vue 2.0 server-side rendering. [Live link](https://vue-ssr-demo-clelqhiaxt.now.sh/)

- Required: Node 4+
- Recommended: Node 6+

``` bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Although this demo uses JSX, it also works with `vue-loader`. It doesn't actually matter how you build your application bundle.
